id make a candle out of it if i ever found it
try to sell it never sell out of it id probably only sell one
itd be to my brother cause we have the same nose
same clothes home grown the stones throw from a creek we used to roam
but it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
out of student loans and tree house homes we all would take the latter


my names blurryface and i care what you think
my names blurryface and i care what you think


wish we could turn back time
to the good old days
when our momma sang us to sleep but
now were stressed out
wish we could turn back time
to the good old days
when our momma sang us to sleep but
now were stressed out

little something for my godson elijah
and a little girl named corin


some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
i say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
i give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2pac cares if dont nobody else care
and i know they like to beat you down a lot
when you come around the block brothers clown a lot
but please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but dont forget girl keep ya head up
and when he tells you you aint nothin dont believe him
and if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
‘cause sister you dont need him
and i aint tryin to gas you up i just call em how i see em
you know what makes me unhappy
when brothers make babies
and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women — do we hate our women
i think its time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we dont well have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man cant make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know youre fed up ladies but keep ya head up


keep ya head up ooh child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up ooh child
thingsll get brighter
keep ya head up ooh child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up ooh child
thingsll get brighter


ayo i remember marvin gaye used to sing to me
he had me feelin like black was the thing to be
and suddenly the ghetto didnt seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize mama really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had to give her was my pipe dream
of how id rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
its hard to be legit and still pay the rent
and in the end it seems im headin for the pen
i try to find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems the rainll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know its funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but cant feed the poor
say there aint no hope for the youth
and the truth is it aint no hope for the future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turnin my brother into a crack baby
we aint meant to survive ‘cause its a set-up
and even though youre fed up huh you got to keep ya head up


keep ya head up ooh child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up ooh child
thingsll get brighter
keep ya head up ooh child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up ooh child
thingsll get brighter


and uh to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
daddys long gone and he left you by your lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
‘cause i think we can make it; in fact im sure
and if you fall stand tall and come back for more
‘cause aint nothin worse than when your son
wants to know why his daddy dont love him no mo
you cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because theres too many things for you to deal with
dyin inside but outside youre lookin fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
you steady hopin things dont fall down this week
‘cause if it did you couldnt take it
and dont blame me — i was given this world i didnt make it
and now my sons gettin older and older
and colder from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
im still tryin to hold on to survivin friends
and its crazy it seems itll never let up
but please you got to keep ya head up

when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought id see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister over the years
we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddies the same drama
when things went wrong wed blame mama
i reminisce on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and whod think in elementary hey
id see the penitentiary one day
and runnin from the police thats right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama
i finally understand
for a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
you always was committed
a poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it
theres no way i can pay you back but the plan
is to show you that i understand you are appreciated


lady dont you know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady dont you know we love ya


now aint nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy ‘cause the coward wasnt there
he passed away and i didnt cry ‘cause my anger
wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
they say im wrong and im heartless but all along
i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs
and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty ‘cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rent is due
i hope you got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
‘cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin home after work late
youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
you just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough youre alone
youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and theres no way i can pay you back but my plan
is to show you that i understand you are appreciated


lady dont you know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady dont you know we love ya


pour out some liquor and i reminisce
‘cause through the drama i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that im hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act crazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
everything will be alright if you hold on
its a struggle every day gotta roll on
and theres no way i can pay you back but my plan
is to show you that i understand you are appreciated


lady dont you know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady dont you know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady lady dear mama
lady lady

take me higher
than i’ve ever been

cursing my government
for not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
you fell asleep in my car i drove the whole time

go ahead and call me a coward
and say that im not strong because im not like you
go ahead and call me crazy
cause i live in a maze tell me how about you
i think i live in my head
sometimes i think that im dead i hide behind my youth
know i been losing my mind
and im a little behind step inside my shoes
cause ive never been happy with myself
and i dont need no one feeling bad for me
trying to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
behind closed doors just close the door
let me be by myself just me and myself
im tired of living i cry
i hear its easy to die i wanna see for myself
and i know that sounds crazy to everyone else
but im depressed as fuck stressed as fuck
aint no medicine that could cure whats the test as drugs
i mean i need extra love
and that aint even enough said that aint even enough
and where the fuck is god god god
damn maybe i aint believing enough
but today we gonna see if hes real
and if he is i guess im prolly going to hell
look i aint wanna die like this
i aint picture my life like this
they dont know what its like like this
pretending im happy so i can smile like this and laugh like you
sometimes i wonder if i ever act like you
could i finally fit in and maybe relax like woo
or would you feel lost without me
cause honestly i think the world is better off without me
and my minds spinning this is the line finish
truth is i dont care how they feel about my feelings
i made up my mind im going out like robin williams

i used to shine now im all in the dark
i remember i used to tell you to follow your heart
but goddammit look at you now its all of your fault
how could you maybe its my fault
i shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin
maybe i should have been more of an influence
i cant believe that youre dead i fu-
i read your letter and all i could do is have mixed feelings about it
but ill forever be attached to you damn
part of me feels bad for you
a part of me feels like you weak and im mad at you
and i dont mean to be insensitive
but i dont understand how we couldnt prevent this shit
you took the easy way out goddammit you did
i mean look what you did im so fucking upset
how could you be so selfish
nigga how could you be so selfish
now youre gone you done left me so helpless
i wonder what god thinks i hope you in gods place
behaving yourself
yo what the fuck you gotta say for yourself say for yourself
look i really feel lost without you
i hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
and my minds spinning this is the line finish
truth is i dont care how you feel about my feelings
and id be lying to you if i told you im fine listen
i know that you can hear me all i need is like five minutes
i just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
im sorry this is something that we both couldnt figure out
i wish i could hear you now is your soul missing
i wonder if you could do it again would you do it different
tell me what death is like
was it meant for you brodie did the heaven support it
are you fucking happy now did you get what you wanted
isnt this what you wanted i feel the temperature falling
and youve been suicidal back then you were nine

i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire exhale desire
i know its dire my time today


i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence


sometimes quiet is violent i find it hard to hide it
my pride is no longer inside
its on my sleeve my skin will scream
reminding me of who i killed inside my dream
i hate this car that im driving theres no hiding for me
im forced to deal with what i feel
there is no distraction to mask what is real
i could pull the steering wheel


i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence


i ponder of something terrifying
cause this time theres no sound to hide behind
i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and its that were all battling fear
oh dear i dont know if we know why were here
oh my too deep please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound
there are things we can do
but from the things that work there are only two
and from the two that we choose to do
peace will win and fear will lose
and theres faith and theres sleep we
need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake
and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think


i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence


and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit


i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire
exhale desire
i know its dire
my time today


i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow


they think this thing is a highway
if it was our way we’d have a tempo change every other time change
cause our mind’s changed on what we think is good
i wasn’t raised in the hood
but i know a thing or two about pain and darkness
if it wasn’t for this music i don’t know how i would have fought this
regardless all these songs i’m hearing are so heartless
don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless honest
there’s a few songs on this record that feel common
i’m in constant confrontation with what i want and what is poppin
in the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
my creativity’s only free when i’m playing shows


they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow
will they be alive tomorrow


i’m sorry if that question i asked last
scared you a bit like a hazmat in a gas mask if you ask zack
he’s my brother he likes when i rap fast
but lets backtrack
back to this
who would you live and die for on that list
but the problem is there’s another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
forget sanity forget salary forget vanity my morality
if you get in between someone i love and me
you’re gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
all these songs i’m hearing are so heartless
don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless


they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow
they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow


but will they be alive tomorrow
but will they be alive tomorrow
but will they be alive tomorrow
but will they be alive tomorrow


they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow
they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow

you know and it gets into this whole issue of border security you know whos gonna say that the borders are secure weve got the house and the senate debating this issue and its its really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants immigrant has somehow become a bad word so the debate rages on and we continue



and just like that it’s over we tend to our wounded we count our dead

black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom…

not yet


i got 1 job 2 job 3 when i need them
i got 5 roommates in this one studio but i never really see them
and we all came america trying to get a lap dance from lady freedom
but now lady liberty is acting like hilary banks with a pre-nup
man i was brave sailing on graves
don’t think i didn’t notice those tombstones disguised as waves
i’m no dummy here is something funny you can be an immigrant without risking your lives
or crossing these borders with thrifty supplies
all you got to do is see the world with new eyes


immigrants we get the job done

look how far i come

it’s a hard line when you’re an import
baby boy its hard times
when you aint sent for
racists feed the belly of the beast
with they pitchforks rich chores
done by the people that get ignored

 
ya se armó
ya se despertaron
it’s a whole awakening
la alarma ya sonó hace rato
los que quieren buscan
pero nos apodan como vagos
we are the same ones
hustling on every level
ten los datos
walk a mile in our shoes
abróchense los zapatos

and it started
and they awoke

the alarm went off a while ago
those who want search
but they label us hoodlums


here’s the details

better buckle your shoes
i been scoping ya dudes ya’ll aint been working like i do
ill outwork you it hurts you

peter piper claimed he picked them he just underpaid pablo

ay yo aye immigrants we don’t like that
na they don’t play british empire strikes back
they beating us like 808’s and high hats
at our own game of invasion but this aint iraq
who these fugees what did they do for me
but contribute new dreams
taxes and tools swagger and food to eat
cool they flee war zones but the problem aint ours
even if our bombs landed on them like the mayflower
buckingham palace or capitol hill
blood of my ancestors had that all built
its the ink you print on your dollar bill oil you spill
thin red line on the flag you hoist when you kill
but still we just say look how far i come
hindustan pakistan to london
to a galaxy far from their ignorance

por tierra o por agua
identidad falsa
brincamos muros o flotamos en balsas
la peleamos como sandino en nicaragua
somos como las plantas que crecen sin agua
sin pasaporte americano
porque la mitad de gringolandia es terreno mexicano
hay que ser bien hijo e puta
nosotros les sembramos el árbol y ellos se comen la fruta
somos los que cruzaron
aquí vinimos a buscar el oro que nos robaron
tenemos mas trucos que la policía secreta
metimos la casa completa en una maleta
con un pico una pala
y un rastrillo
te construimos un castillo
como es que dice el coro cabrón

by land or by water
false identity
we jump over walls or float on rafts
we fight like sandino in nicaragua
we are like plants that grow without wáter
without an american passport
because half of  gringolandia is really mexican terrain
one has to be a real son of a bitch
we plant the tree and they reap the fruit

we are the ones who cross
here we come to look for the gold that was stolen
we have more tricks than the secret police
we packed our entire house in one suitcase
with a pick a shovel
and a rake
we built you a castle
how’s the chorus go again cabron

im taking over my body
back in control no more shotty
i bet a lot of me was lost
ts uncrossed and is undotted
i fought it a lot and it seems a lot
like flesh is all i got
not any more flesh out the door swat
i mustve forgot you cant trust me
im open a moment and closed when you show it
before you know it im lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it
and the story unfolds
you should take my life
you should take my soul


you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes
and ill be holding on to you
and ill be holding on to you


remember the moment
you know exactly where youre goin
cause the next moment before you know it
time is slowin and its frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice right
you think twice about your life
it probably happens at night right
fight it take the pain ignite it
tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breath fine and tie it
to a tree tell it
you belong to me this aint a noose
this is a leash and i have news for you
you must obey me


you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range
of my left-side brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes


entertain my faith
entertain my faith
entertain my faith
entertain my faith

lean with it rock with it
when we gonna stop with it
lyrics that mean nothing
we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet
to an introspective beat
it aint the speakers that bump hearts
its our hearts that make the beat


and ill be holding on to you
and ill be holding on to you
and ill be holding on to you
and ill be holding on to you
and ill be holding on to you
and ill be holding on to you
and ill be holding on to you

when the leader of the bad guys sang
something soft and soaked in pain
i heard the echo from his secret hideaway
he mustve forgot to close his door
as he cranked out those dismal chords
and his four walls declared him insane


i found my way
right time wrong place
as i pled my case


youre the judge oh no

i know my souls freezing
hells hot for good reason

three lights are lit
but the fourth ones out
i can tell cause its a bit darker
than the last nights bout
i forgot about the drought
of light bulbs in this house
so i head out
down a route i think is heading south
but im not good with directions
and i hide behind my mouth
im a pro at imperfections
and im best friends with my doubt
and now that my minds out
and now i hear it clear and loud
im thinking
wow i probably shouldve stayed inside my house


i found my way
right time wrong place
as i pled my case


youre the judge oh no
set me free
youre the judge oh no
set me free
i know my souls freezing
hells hot for good reason

i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through the valley of death
i shed so many tears
if i should die before i wake
please god walk with me
grab a nigga and take me to heaven


back in elementary i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dyin breed
inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can you feel me im not livin in the past
you wanna last be the first to blast
remember kato no longer with us hes deceased
call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
now he rest in peace
is there a heaven for a g remember me
so many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears


i suffered through the years
and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers
and shed so many tears


now that im strugglin in this business by any means
label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause im cursed
im havin visions of leavin here in a hearse
god can you feel me
take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
show me some happiness again
im goin blind i spend my time in this cell aint livin well
i know my destiny is hell—where did i fail
my life is in denial and when i die
baptized in eternal fire shed so many tears


lord i suffered through the years
and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers
and shed so many tears


now im lost and im weary so many tears
im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a calculated step
to bring me closer to embrace an early death
now theres nothin left
there was no mercy on the streets
i couldnt rest im barely standin
about to go to pieces screamin peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just a misery
paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
will i survive til the morning to see the sun
please lord forgive me for my sins cause here i come


lord god
i suffered through the years
and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers


and lord knows i tried been a witness to homicide
seen drive-bys takin lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
broken-hearted as i glance at the chalk line gettin high
this aint the life for me i wanna change
but aint no future bright for me im stuck in the game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
disillusioned lately ive been really wantin babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
im hearin noises think shes fuckin all my boys
cant take no more im fallin to the floor
beggin for the lord to let me in to heavens door
shed so many tears


lord lost so many peers
and shed so many tears
i lost so many peers
and shed so many tears
lord i suffered many years
and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers
and shed so many tears

waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
shadows will scream that im alone
lone lone lone


i-i-i ive got a migraine
and my pain will range from up down and sideways
thank god its friday cause fridays will always be better than sundays
cause sundays are my suicide days
i dont know why they always seem so dismal
thunderstorms clouds snow and a slight drizzle
whether its the weather or the letters by my bed
sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
let it be said what the headache represents
its me defending in suspense
its me suspended in a defenseless test
being tested by a ruthless examinant
thats represented best by my depressing thoughts
i do not have writers block my writer just hates the clock
it will not let me sleep i guess ill sleep when im dead
and sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head


am i the only one i know
waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
shadows will scream that im alone
but i know weve made it this far kid

yeah yeah yeah


i am not as fine as i seem
pardon me for yelling and telling you green gardens
are not whats growing in my psyche its a different me
a difficult beast feasting lumbered burnt down trees
freeze frame please let me paint a mental picture portrait
something you wont forget its all about my forehead
and how it is a door that holds back contents
that makes pandoras box contents look non-violent
behind my eyelids are islands of violence
my mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find
i did not know it was such a violent island
full of tidal waves suicidal crazed lions
theyre trying to eat me blood running down their chin
and i know that i can fight or i can let the lion win
i begin to assemble what weapons i can find
cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind


am i the only one i know
waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
shadows will scream that im alone
but i know weve made it this far kid

yeah
yeah yeah yeah oh oh
yeah yeah yeah


and i will say that we should take a day to break away
from all the pain our brain has made
the game is not played alone
and i will say that we should take a moment and hold it
and keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

and i will say that we should take a day to break away
from all the pain our brain has made
the game is not played alone
and i will say that we should take a moment and hold it
and keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone


am i the only one i know oh
waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
shadows will scream that im alone
but i know weve made it this far kid


made it this far
made it this f

people they rhyme like this were all impressed by this
they rip it flip it but these are just triplets
wrote this in three minutes three words to a line
its just poetry divided im the kind of guy
who takes every moment he knows he confided in
music to use it for others to use it
youre dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this
life is up here but you comment below
when the comments below will always become common
motivation to promote your shows next episode
so your brain knows to keep going even though hope
is far from this moment
but you and i know it gets better
when morning finally rears its head
together were losers
remember the future
remember the morning is when night is dead


release me from the present

totin them pistols and serving them addicts

niggas aint flyer than me im getting to it
feel like the man i got the plan
i call the shooters they hop out the van
play with the squad get popped like a xan
pop like a perc im goin ham
im goin crazy on niggas too wavy for niggas
do magic like alakazam
im in the kitchen compressin a birdie
take out a nine and i sell it for thirty
then straight to the jeweler im bustin a rollie
to light up the city like meechie in 03
i got the plug he send em ot
dont know these niggas these niggas know me
even old niggas they call me og
young nigga but i put it down

all of sudden niggas wanna come around

and then look at yourself
and see how you playing yourself nigga

i knew you would show who you was
its only a matter of time before niggas get lying
and hit with them slugs

sick and tired of seeing niggas lose
sinning like we tryna get to hell


this is my blues
cause im back down on my own again
this is the blues im playing
yes its a final thing
when the night is cold and lonely




i wake up fine and dandy
but then by the time i find it handy
to rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
i go up up up up up to the ceiling
then i feel my soul start leaving
like an old mans hair receding
im pleading please oh please
on my knees repeatedly asking
why its got to be like this
is this living free
i dont wanna be the one
be the one to have the suns blood on my hands
ill tell the moon
take this weapon forged in darkness
some see a pen i see harpoon


ill stay awake
cause the darks not taking prisoners tonight
why am i not scared in the morning
i dont hear those voices calling
i must have kicked them out
i must have kicked them out
i swear i heard demons yelling
those crazy words they were spelling
they told me i was gone
they told me i was gone


but i tell em
why wont you let me go
do i threaten all your plans
im insignificant
please tell em
you have no plans for me
i will set my soul on fire
what have i become
ill tell em


on the eve of a day thats forgotten and fake
as the trees they await and clouds anticipate
the start of a day when we put on our face
a mask that portrays that we dont need grace
on the eve of a day that is bigger than us
but we open our eyes cause were told that we must
and the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
desperately yelling theres something we need
im not free i asked forgiveness three times
same amount that i denied i three-time mvpd this crime
im afraid to tell you who i adore
wont tell you who im singing towards
metaphorically im a whore and thats denial number four


ill stay awake
cause the darks not taking prisoners tonight
why am i not scared in the morning
i dont hear those voices calling
i must have kicked them out
i must have kicked them out
i swear i heard demons yelling
those crazy words they were spelling
they told me i was gone
they told me i was gone


but i tell em
why wont you let me go
do i threaten all your plans
im insignificant
please tell em
you have no plans for me
i will set my soul on fire
what have i become


ill tell em
you have have no plans for me
i will set my soul on fire
what have i become
ill tell em
ill tell em
ill tell em
ill tell em
please tell em
you have no plans for me
i will set my soul on fire
what have i become

i know what you think in the morning
when the sun shines on the ground
and shows what you have done
it shows where your mind has gone
and you swear to your parents
that it will never happen again
i know i know-ow-ow what that means i know-ow-ow-ow


that you all have guns
and you never put the safety on
and you all have plans
to take it to take it dont take it take it take it
im trying im trying to sleep
im trying im trying to sleep
but i cant but i cant when you all have
guns for hands yeah
im trying im trying to sleep
im trying im trying to sleep
but i cant but i cant when you all have
guns for hands yeah


lets take this a second at a time
lets take this one song this one rhyme
together lets breathe
together to the beat
but theres hope out the window
so thats where well go
lets go outside and all join hands
but until then youll never understand


that you all have guns
and you never put the safety on
and you all have plans
to take it to take it dont take it take it take it
im trying im trying to sleep
im trying im trying to sleep

da-da-da-da-da ah uh
da-da-da-da-da


weve turned our hands to guns
traded our thumbs for ammunition
i must forewarn you of my disorder or my condition
cause when the sun sets
it upsets whats left of my invested interest
interested in putting my fingers to my head
the solution is i see a whole room of these mutant kids
fused at the wrist
i simply tell them they should shoot at this
simply suggest my chest and this confused music its
obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist


im trying im trying to sleep
im trying im trying to sleep
but i cant but i cant when you all have
guns for hands yeah
im trying im trying to sleep im trying to sleep
im trying im trying to sleep im trying to sleep
but i cant but i cant when you all have
